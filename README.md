# Airdrop Contract README

## Overview

This is a simple Ethereum smart contract designed for distributing tokens to a list of addresses. The contract allows the owner to specify the token address, the airdrop amount, and to perform an airdrop to a list of recipient addresses. Additionally, the owner can withdraw any remaining tokens from the contract.

## Features

- Set the token address and airdrop amount.
- Airdrop tokens to a list of recipient addresses.
- Withdraw any remaining tokens from the contract.

## Contract Details

- Contract Address: [Contract Address]
- Token Address: [Token Address]

## Usage

1. Deploy the Airdrop Contract on the Ethereum network using Remix or your preferred development environment.

2. Set the token address and airdrop amount using the contract functions:
   - `setTokenAddress(address _tokenAddress)`: Set the token address.
   - `setAirdropAmount(uint256 _airdropAmount)`: Set the airdrop amount.

3. Perform the airdrop:
   - Call the `airdrop` function with an array of recipient addresses to distribute tokens evenly among them. Ensure that the contract has a sufficient token balance for the airdrop.

4. Withdraw remaining tokens:
   - Use the `withdraw` function to withdraw any remaining tokens from the contract.

## Development

To develop and deploy this contract, follow these steps:

1. Write the contract in Solidity, specifying the ERC20 token interface (if not already available).

2. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network.

3. Use Remix or other Ethereum development tools to interact with the contract, set the token address and airdrop amount, and perform the airdrop.

4. Verify the contract on Etherscan for transparency.

## Notes

- Ensure that you are the owner of the contract, and no one else can access your contract's private keys.

- Verify the contract's functionality and test it with a smaller set of addresses before performing a large-scale airdrop.
